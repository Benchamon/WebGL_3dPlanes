# WebGL_3dPlanes
A simple "modeling" app in WebGL that uses planes to create a figure.

Quick guide

To start the program open the "index.html" file in a browser that supports WebGl.

There are two canvas on the page, the left one is for displaying the current
index and the right one is for all the planes.

To add planes you need to click on the left canvas, but keep in mind the depth
of the vertices and also the color of the points. You need at least 3 to create a plane.

To create a new plane do a right-click.

You can change between planes by selecting the index with the buttons.

You can modify the selected plane by changing the sliders values.

There are "Global" slider that only affect the view of the right canvas.

The "Undo Last" button errase the last triangle made in the currently selected plane.
The "Errase All" button clears completely both canvases and eliminates all planes.
